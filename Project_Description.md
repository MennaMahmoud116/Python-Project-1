HIV Genome Analysis.

This project aimed to test my knowledge after taking the "Introduction to Bioinformatics" course in using python. Here, I am analyzing an HIV genome of a size "9719", where I extracted the sequences of 5 major HIV genes. Then, calculated the GC-content for each gene. In addition to translating each gene to protein. Next, I computed the trinucleotides frequencies in the HIV genome. Finally, plotting the trinucleotides frequencies.
